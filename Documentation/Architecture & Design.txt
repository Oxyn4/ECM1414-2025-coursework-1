Scan and Look Algorithms Explanations
    Example Requests: Starts at floor 5 going up, needs to stop at 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6
    
    SCAN:
        -The elevator will travel in one direction until it reaches the end of its range and then reversing direction
    Example:
        -Starting at floor 5 and moving upwards, it will stop at 6, 7, 9, then travelling to floor 10, when it will then
        reverse its direction to floors 4, 3, 1.

    LOOK:
        -LOOK algorithm is similar to SCAN but focuses on only going as far as the furthest request in the current direction.
    Example:
        -Starting at floor 5 and going upwards, the elevator will stop at floors 6, 7, 9. After reaching the furthest requested floor
        it will reverse direction and visit floors 4, 3, 1.
