(A)Organize the team, coordinate progress, and ensure timely delivery. 
Research SCAN and LOOK algorithms and design the system architecture. 
Responsible for the final documentation of the system design. 

 (B)Design and implement data structures (queue, priority queue, heap). 
Develop data_structures.py and algorithms.py to implement SCAN and LOOK algorithms. 
Ensure algorithm correctness and write unit tests. 

 (C)Implement elevator simulation in simulation.py. 
Set elevator capacity, operating speed, and floor movement time. 
Handle real-time requests and support multi-floor, high-concurrency scenarios. 

 (D)Implement real-time scheduling logic in algorithms.py. 
Conduct performance testing under high-load and low-load conditions. 
Record test data and compare the efficiency of SCAN and LOOK algorithms.

(E)Write detailed project documentation, covering design, implementation, and testing. 
Generate performance comparison charts and analyze experimental results. 
Record and edit a demonstration video showcasing the system in action. I have written a draft, perhaps we can refer to it.
